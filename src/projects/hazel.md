# Hazel : <small>Node.js wiki knowledge base</small>

Hazel is a Fully-featured open source wiki knowledge base system with the flexibility to handle anything from product documentation to personal wikis.

The result is a light, static document driven site utilizing Express.js and Node.js. No databases or complex integrations. Write your documents with your favorite text editor or right within Hazel itself.

Documents are composed with Markdown, which allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which is then converted into structurally valid HTML.
