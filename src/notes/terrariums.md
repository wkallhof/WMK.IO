# Terrariums

## Goals
- A reasonably low maintenance terrarium system
- Visually appealing

## Secondary Goals
- Self sustaining terrarium

## Notes
>Terrariums don't have their own drainage, like you would have with a planter with a hole in the bottom, so you have to create a drainage layer so your plant's roots aren't sitting in water. Woodland terrariums, like the one I'm making, enjoy moist environments, but still can't tolerate swampy conditions, particularly if you're heavy-handed with the watering can. One way around this is by adding a generous layer of stone and activated charcoal underneath a soil layer. Additionally you can use a cardboard egg carton, as I demonstrate here, to add some additional air flow below while still having a moisture-wicking container for the plants in the carton. - Homestead Brooklyn

## Possible Plants & Features
- ferns, baby tears, golden club moss, creeping fig, and Alocasia

## Steps
> 1. Take note to how deep your terrarium basin is. If it's shallow, like mine was (~ 2"), then just note that you'll likely be planting smaller plants since you'll need adequate drainage, which will be created by the stone layer.

> 2. Place a layer of stone on the base of the terrarium. I could only muster around 3/4" inch or less of stone in my terrarium, since it's a shallow basin.

> 3. Next add a thin layer of charcoal. This helps reduce any bacterial buildup in the soil and around the roots of the plant.

> 4. If you're going to use an egg carton, then I would add it to the terrarium now. The benefit of the egg carton is as follows: The "pockets" underneath the carton creates good air flow, and if you ever overwater the terrarium, the plant roots will be "saved" from the swamp. Plus the egg carton acts as a moisture-wicking layer. This is particularly valuable for plants like orchids. Additionally, I like how the egg carton can create a natural "terrain" within the terrarium.

> 5. Begin to plot out where you want your plants in the terrarium and other features, like stones and wood. I typically like to sketch a layout in advance, but I improvised this one.

> 6. Place some soil in the terrarium and begin planting your plants, making sure that they are firmly planted in the correct potting soil. Because I am doing a woodland terrarium, I went with a potting soil, peat moss mix.

> 7. Do any additional touches to the terrarium. 

> 8. Spray the terrarium generously with a mister. 

> 9. Place top on, taking care not to crush any leaves of plants that may be peeking out of the edges. 

> 10. Place your woodland terrarium in an area that isn't directly up against any sunny windows. Too much sun will cook or burn the plants, as the glass acts as a little greenhouse. I have two of my terrariums about 7 feet (2 meters) away from a North-facing window.
