# Indoor Plants

## Air plants
Tillandsia

>Tillandsia or air plants, as they are commonly called, are members of the Bromeliaceae family, and can be used as the terrestrial equivalents to aquatic insects. Because of their epiphytic nature, they need no soil, as all their water and nutrients are absorbed through the specialized trichomes, which are scale-like hairs on their leaves. In fact, it's these scales on the surface, which can act a little like dust collectors, grabbing hold of droplets of water, the dust that the water formed around, and any dissolved salts. - Homestead Brooklyn

>Tillandsias, generally speaking, prefer bright light conditions, but their foliage can help you determine a more precise lighting requirement. For instance, thicker, gray-leaved varieties prefer bright light, whereas the greenish, softer-leaved varieties prefer a little less sun. Most Tillandsias that you can buy for your home prefer humid conditions. If you have a drier home environment, like most of us doâ€”at least in the Northeast, get a spray bottle and spray your air plants. It's challenging to say how many times to spray them because it really depends on the home environment, but typically 2-3 times a week is adequate. Additionally, I like to "bathe" mine for around 30-45 minutes on a biweekly basis (preferably lukewarm water or water that has been sitting out for a few hours). This simply means "dunking" them in water and then thoroughly drying them out afterwards. Wet air plants will slowly rot, so I'd suggest thoroughly shaking them off or even placing them near a fan or an open window with a breeze to increase air flow. If the air plant is in bloom, then try not to get the flower wet. Instead, just spray the plant, or carefully dunk it in a container filled with water without letting the bloom touch. - Homestead Brooklyn

>Some of the popular ways to display air plants in the home are on wood mounts or in glass bulbs. Glass bulbs are chosen, not only for their aesthetics, but also because they help maintain humidity around the plant. ðŸŒ¿ - Homestead Brooklyn

## Hard to Kill
### Chinese Evergreen (Aglaonema commutatum)
Grows well in low to medium light. The soil should be evenly moist but can survive bouts of dryness. It has a sap that is an irritant, so keep away from curious pets and children.

### Snake Plants (Sansevieria sp.)
Grows best in bright light but can tolerate low light conditions.

### Zeezee plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia)
Grows best in bright light but will tolerate low light. It also prefers dry soil.

### Dumbcane (Dieffenbachia sp.)
Grows in low light. It thrives in low to medium light. It contains raphides, which can cause stinging and burning sensations in the mouth and throat, so be sure to wash your hands if you have to cut the plant and also be mindful around pets and children.

### Schefflera (Schefflera sp.)
Enjoys bright light and is a strong grower.

### Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)
You can grow the plants in hanging baskets or in pots. Grows in everything from indirect light to bright light.

### Radiator Plant (Peperomia sp.)
Peperomias are small houseplants that are good in low or medium light.

### Cast-iron plant (Aspidistra elatior)
This plant is virtually indestructible. It is extremely tolerant of low light conditions and irregular watering. The only thing that this hardy plant doesnâ€™t seem to tolerate is direct sun.


## Indoor Plants that Bloom in Winter
 - Jasmine (Jasminum sp.)
 Once it blooms, prune it back quite heavily

 - Anthurium (Anthurium sp.)
 - Begonia (Begonia sp.)
 - Desert Rose (Adenium sp.)

 - Bleeding Heart Vine (Clerodendrum x speciosum)
 - Kalanchoe (Kalanchoe blossfeldiana sp.)
 - Cyclamen (Cyclamen sp.)
 - Amarylis (Amarylis sp.)
 - African Violet (Saintpaulia ionantha)
 - Christmas Cactus (Schlumbergera truncata)
 - Hawaiian Wedding Vine (Marsdenia floribunda)
 - String-of-Pearls (Senecio rowleyanus)
 - Crown-of-Thorns (Euphorbia milii)
 - Poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima)
