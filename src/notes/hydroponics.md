## Use of plastics
With the general goal in life to reduce how much plastic I use, especially single use plastics, I wanted to look into what options were available with hydroponic setups to limit plastic use. For context, most setups appear to utilize PVC piping, plastic irrigation tubing, etc.

>Most hydroponic reservoirs are now built of plastic, but other materials have been used including concrete, glass, metal, vegetable solids, and wood. The containers should exclude light to prevent algae and fungal growth in the nutrient solution. - Wikipedia


My initial thought was bamboo. It is a naturally occuring, organic, rigid structure that could be utilized for replacing both the PCV and tubing elements.
