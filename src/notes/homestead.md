- [ ] Determine kWh usage per day
- [ ] Calculate solar array size : (kWh usage per day) / ((peak sunlight hours) * (0.75 efficiency))
* Could be as expensive as 3.5$ to 5$ per watt
* 30% subsidies from government until 2019
- [ ] Determine if the utility company will buy back electricity dsireusa.org
